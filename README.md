# Robot_Arm

Implemented program by recursively rendering the arm
It contains forward and inverse kinematics. 

To run the program, double click html file

forward kinematics:
control the robot arm using the sliders

inverse kinematics:
click on the window 
the red dot will forms where the user clicked and 
the robot arm will reach out to point the spot.
If the robot arm cannot reach the position where the user clicked, 
the arm does not move. 

Inverse kinematics only works when the user does not rotate the robot arm with the slider

Thank you
